Open the pcap file within a Linux virtual machine such as Ubuntu or Kali Linux! This file does contain live malware that can damage/destroy your system. It is recommended to use a non-windows system with some examples mentioned above. If and when you need to export parts of the .pcap for further analysis, it is recommended to save the file NOT AS AS executable (.exe) OR dynamic link library (.dll) file as both can be and are armed.

Marc Wright and Joe Cox are your points of contact for this element of assessment. 

Arrangements for submission 
Please submit one document online via Moodle:

Your report as a word document.
This assessment will be marked anonymously. This means Moodle will hide student identities from the marker during the marking process. To protect this anonymity, please do not incorporate your personal details, including your name, email and student number anywhere within the actual assignment or its file name.  Please also be aware that if you take an extension, it may not be possible for your work to be marked anonymously. This is because the technology reveals all student identities to the marker on the standard feedback return date, but your assignment might be marked after this.  If you have any questions about anonymous assessment, please contact your Module Tutor. 

The requirements for the assessment 
You have been in touch with a recruitment agency for ideas on how to progress your career and to assess your current skill levels. In response to this, the recruitment agency has asked you for the following documents so they can accurately find you roles which are suitable based on your current skill level and career goals: 

Technical competency review: Based on the case study provided, provide an analysis of what happened, the tools used for your investigation, and recommendations on how the company could improve their security. 

Identification of desired job roles: Research on three potential job roles you are interested in (whether to start your career, or potential next steps in the career ladder), and provide evidence of these roles in an appendix. 

A career direction document (based on the career direction template) which identifies your current technical and transferable skills and maps out the future technical and transferable skills you will need to develop based on the three job roles identified. 

Technical competency review case study: 

Despite the security measures you had put in place at Caribex, there has been an cyber attack at the company. Caribex had recently appointed a new Transporter which has received an email and has ran the attachment which has lead to an attack happening on their machine. With the IP address " 192.168.1.133 ", the IT team was able to use the Caribex network traffic logging data store to isolate full-capture .pcap data for that system during the period of interest (see attached .pcap file, can be found on the one drive link on the main Moodle page.). The IT team did identify that some of the connections from the machine do look dangerous and would like you to perform an investigation on to what has happened in the network traffic. They would like the attacks identified, and to know what specific attack has taken place

Furthermore, Caribex is concerned about how easily it was for their staff to be subject to receiving malicious emails and has come back to you for your advice as a cyber-security consultant. Your objective is to create a report for Caribex providing an analysis of what happened, in addition to recommendations on how to improve their security.  

Assessment Structure: 

Your assessment should contain the following parts: 

Analysis of Investigative Tools  – In this section you should provide an analysis of the tools you used for your investigation, detailing why they are beneficial, and any limitations. 

The Investigation – You should detail the steps taken to investigate the breach with screenshots as evidence. This should include the use of a sandbox environment to run your packet analysing software. In this section you should document everything that looks suspicious and try to explain what happened. 

Recommendations on how to mitigate threats and improve security  - This section should include an explanation and justification of any recommended security measures or procedures based on the attack which happened and other similar attacks that Caribex may be susceptible to. This section should include addressing concerns about the nature of the attack/breach, and what can be done to directly address this issue in future. This section should discuss both technical and non-technical security measures and should relate to academic literature. 

References (not included in word count) 

Appendix 1 (not included in word count) – Three researched job roles  

Appendix 2 (not included in the word count) – Career direction document 

Please note that failure to include evidence of the three job roles and the career direction document will result in an automatic referral. 
Assessment Criteria Notes: 

Marks will be awarded for the accuracy and level of detail explaining what happened in the pcap file, and for the general quality of your report. It is expected that where applicable, you will relate your report to tools, methods and content discussed throughout the module, to academic literature, reports of attacks in the sector, and any relevant guidelines/standards. Higher marks are awarded where there is greater justification of points made, greater relevancy of points to the case provided, and where limitations and alternatives are also discussed.
